## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Next.js 15 (App Router) + Supabase + Vercel Hobby — single free-tier deployment
- Auth: Email/password via Supabase Auth; George approves every registration
- Scoring: Pure function library (no side effects) — runs in web app, admin recalc, and offline fallback
- Visibility gating: Enforced at database level via Supabase RLS (cannot be bypassed client-side)
- Lockout: Server-side rejection where `fixture.kickoff_time < now()` — client-side alone is insufficient
- Bonuses: Two-phase (member picks, George confirms) — nothing auto-applied
- Phase 7 (Mid-Season Import) is a launch blocker — must complete before real members register
- XLSX library: Pin to xlsx v0.18.x — v0.19+ changed to paid license
- BST/GMT: Store all kick-offs as UTC; display converts to Europe/London timezone
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Scaffold workaround: create-next-app temp subdirectory then move files to project root (directory name violates npm naming)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: RLS admin JWT path: (auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role') = 'admin' (may need adjustment per Supabase project settings)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-planning] George must sign off on scoring spec (bonus interactions — especially Golden Glory + Double Bubble stacking) before Phase 6 coding begins
- [Pre-planning] Verify football-data.org free tier still covers PL fixtures (API may have changed since training cutoff)
- [Pre-planning] Confirm Supabase pg_cron is available on free tier for keep-alive and result polling
- [Pre-planning] Confirm George's existing spreadsheet format before building Phase 7 import UI
